# Fitness Tracker

This fitness tracker was created to log exercises completed each day. The user can input the type of exercise, total weight, number of sets and reps, and the total duration. This exercise can be combined with others and then aggregated into one daily task. The dashboard page displays the data from the last 7 days of exercise and each individual day can be clicked on for more information. The data for the site is hosted by MongoDB and the site is build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
